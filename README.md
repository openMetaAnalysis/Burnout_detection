Job crafting
============================================
A living systematic review

Short url: https://ebmgt.github.io/job-crafting/

**Definitions** 
* "Job crafting" is "workers actively change the actual or perceived characteristics of their jobs in order to better match the demands placed on them and the resources available" (Topa and Aranda-Carmena, 2022 PMID [36232011](http://pubmed.gov/36232011))​
* "Collaborative job crafting" is "[workers] can jointly determine how to modify the work to meet their shared goals" (Topa and Aranda-Carmena, 2022 PMID [36232011](http://pubmed.gov/36232011))​
* Job crafting can be combined with "knowledge sharing", such as Googler2Googler (G2) in which the organization helps disseminate successful job crafting.

**Clinical summary:** This meta-analysis suggests that clinical intervention *is* moderately effective. [Standarized mean differences](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-15#section-15-3) across outcomes range from 0.49 to 0.78. Heterogeneity of results as measured by I<sup>2</sup> was '[moderate](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/current/chapter-10#section-10-10-2)' at 0% for all analyses but very wide confidence intervals reflect the small number of studies and subjects. This review updates previously published meta-analysis(es).(citation[s] below)

Meta-regression of common modulators (year of publication, study size, event rate in the control groups) finds that the outcome of the intervention is effected by xx.

**Methods overview:** This repository is an [openMetaAnalysis](https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/) that combines methods of scoping, rapid, and living systematic reviews.  This analysis updates one or more previously published review(s) below. A comparison of studies included in this review compared to prior reviews are in the table, [reconciliation of trials included with prior meta-analyses/](files/reconciliation-tables/Reconciliation%20of%20studies.pdf). Newer studies included are listed in the references below. Rationale for newer trials excluded may be listed at the end of the references.
